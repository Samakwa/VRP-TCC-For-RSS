# VRP-TCC-For-RSS
#VRP (Vehicular Routing Problem) With and Time and Capacity constraints For RSS

Most recent prograom:
Geocordinate_distance.py


There are different stages in solving the RSS problem.
The sequence of the programs use will be updated ASAP. Some of the functions already developed are: 

Complete_graph.py:
Combines Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm, networkx libraries and Floyd-Warshall Algorithm

Constraints.py:
This algorithm recursively implements the constraints for a Networkx graph

Adding_loc.py:
This is program for the optimization of routes.
Contains 5 functions

Geocordinate_distance.py:
This function calculates actual distance, using latitudes and longitudes.
Implements the Complete Graph function on earth surface. The coordinates may then be visualised in Google maps
